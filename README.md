# lab-fervour
This is website for a Melbourne artist that I built. It was an exercise in JavaScript and JQuery so I limited myself to just those without using any other libraries or frameworks.

The results can be seen here http://labfervour.richgarner.net/

built using:
* JavaScript
* JQuery

consists of:
* various JavaScript objects for creating a Gallery and carousel, and linking this in with the selectable thumbnails
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript to pull it all together
